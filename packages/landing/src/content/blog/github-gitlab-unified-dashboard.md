Context switching between GitHub and GitLab is one of the biggest productivity killers for developers. We hear you, and we're building something to help.

## The Problem We're Solving

If you work in a modern development environment, you probably recognize this scenario:

- Your team uses **GitHub** for some projects and **GitLab** for others
- You're constantly **switching tabs** between GitHub and GitLab
- PRs pile up and you **lose track** of what needs your attention
- You wish you could see **everything in one place**

## What's Coming: Multi-Provider Support

We're actively working on multi-provider support for PR Manager. Here's what this means:

### Connect Both GitHub and GitLab

Soon, you'll be able to connect **both** GitHub and GitLab accounts to PR Manager simultaneously. Your Pull Requests from both platforms will appear in a single, unified list.

### One Dashboard, All Your PRs

Instead of switching between tabs, you'll see:

- PRs from all your GitHub repositories
- PRs from all your GitLab repositories
- Visual indicators showing which provider each PR belongs to
- All in one scrollable, filterable list

### Smart Filtering Across Providers

Create custom views that span both providers:

- "All Pending Reviews" - PRs waiting for your review from **any** provider
- "My Open PRs" - Everything you've opened across GitHub **and** GitLab
- "Ready to Merge" - Approved PRs with passing CI from both platforms

## What You Can Do Today

While we're building multi-provider support, PR Manager already helps you manage PRs from your chosen provider:

### Choose GitHub or GitLab

Currently, you can connect **either** GitHub or GitLab to PR Manager and enjoy:

- **Unified dashboard** for all your repositories on that provider
- **Native notifications** that work without your browser
- **Custom views** to organize your PRs
- **Quick actions** to approve, comment, and merge

### All the Features You Need

Whether you're using GitHub or GitLab, you get:

- Real-time notifications on macOS and Windows
- Custom filtered views for your PRs
- Pin important PRs for quick access
- Follow individual PRs for updates
- Approve, request changes, comment, and merge from the app

## Stay Updated

Multi-provider support is a top priority on our roadmap. Want to know when it's ready?

1. **Download PR Manager** and start using it with your primary provider
2. **Follow us** for announcements about new features
3. **Send feedback** - your input helps us prioritize

## In the Meantime

- Manage PRs across **multiple repositories** on GitHub or GitLab
- Want **desktop notifications** that don't get lost
- Need to **organize and filter** your PR list
- Want to **approve and merge** without opening your browser
