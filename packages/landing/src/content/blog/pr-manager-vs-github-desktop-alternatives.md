## PR Manager: Purpose-Built for PRs

PR Manager is designed specifically for **Pull Request management**. It's not a Git client - you won't use it to commit code or manage branches. Instead, it focuses entirely on the PR workflow.

### Best For

- Developers who manage PRs across multiple repos
- Teams using GitHub or GitLab (multi-provider coming soon)
- Anyone who wants dedicated PR notifications
- Tech leads overseeing multiple repositories

### What It Does Well

**1. Provider Flexibility**
Connect to GitHub or GitLab - your choice. Multi-provider support (using both simultaneously) is on the roadmap for a future release.

**2. Custom Views**
Create saved views with filters. Organize PRs by status, author, repository, or review state.

**3. Native Notifications**
Real-time desktop notifications that work even when your browser is closed.

**4. Quick Actions**
Approve, request changes, comment, and merge directly from the app.

**5. Focus on PRs**
Because it only does PR management, it does it well. No feature bloat.

### What It Doesn't Do

- Git operations (commit, push, pull, branch)
- Code editing
- Inline code comments (use browser for detailed reviews)

### Pricing

Currently **free during beta**.

## GitHub Desktop: Git GUI

GitHub Desktop is GitHub's official desktop client. It's primarily a Git GUI with minimal PR features.

### Best For

- Developers new to Git
- GitHub-only teams
- Those who prefer GUI over command line for Git operations

### What It Does Well

**1. Git Operations**
Full Git client - clone, commit, push, pull, branch management, all in a clean GUI.

**2. Beginner Friendly**
Makes Git operations approachable for newcomers.

**3. Free**
Completely free, maintained by GitHub.

### Limitations

- **No GitLab support**
- Minimal PR management
- No custom views or filtering
- No notification system

### When to Choose GitHub Desktop

- You need a Git GUI
- You only use GitHub
- PR management isn't a priority

## GitKraken: Premium Git Client

GitKraken is a polished Git client with collaboration features in paid tiers.

### Best For

- Teams wanting a premium Git experience
- Organizations with budget for paid tools
- Developers who want great Git visualization

### What It Does Well

One of the most visually polished Git clients.

**2. Git Visualization**

- PR features are secondary to Git features
- No dedicated PR notification system

### Pricing

- Free: Limited features
- Pro: $4.95/month
- Teams: $8.95/user/month

## Just Using the Browser

Many developers just use GitHub.com and GitLab.com directly.

### Pros

- No additional software
- Full feature access
- Works everywhere

### Cons

- **Tab overload** - Multiple repos = multiple tabs
- **Notification noise** - Email notifications get buried
- **Context switching** - Constantly jumping between GitHub and GitLab
- **No unified view** - Can't see all PRs in one place

## Decision Guide

### Choose PR Manager If:

- You manage PRs across **multiple repositories**
- You want **dedicated notifications** for PRs
- PR management is a significant part of your day
- You want to **approve/comment/merge** without browser tabs
- You use GitHub or GitLab (multi-provider support coming soon)

### Choose GitHub Desktop If:

- You **only use GitHub**
- You want a **Git GUI** for basic operations
- PR management is minimal

### Choose GitKraken If:

- You want a **premium Git client**
- You need **Git visualization**
- You have budget for paid tools

### Stick with Browser If:

- You only manage a few PRs
- You don't mind tab switching
- You need features not available in desktop apps

## Common Combinations

Many developers use multiple tools:

### PR Manager + Terminal

Use command line for Git operations (commit, push, pull), PR Manager for all PR management.

**Best for:** Experienced developers comfortable with Git CLI.

### PR Manager + GitHub Desktop

Use GitHub Desktop for Git operations, PR Manager for PR management.

**Best for:** Developers who prefer GUI for Git but want better PR tools.

### PR Manager + Browser

Use PR Manager for quick reviews and monitoring, browser for detailed line-by-line reviews.

**Best for:** Everyone - they complement each other well.

## Conclusion

The right choice depends on:

1. **Which Git provider you use** - PR Manager supports both GitHub and GitLab
2. **How important PR management is** - Casual vs. heavy PR workflow
3. **Your preferred interface** - Terminal, GUI, or browser

For anyone who spends significant time on code review, **PR Manager offers focused and efficient PR management** that other tools don't prioritize.
