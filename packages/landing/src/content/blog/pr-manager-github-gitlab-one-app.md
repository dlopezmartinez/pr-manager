As developers, we spend a significant part of our day reviewing code. Pull Requests are the backbone of modern collaborative development, but managing them across multiple repositories and platforms can quickly become overwhelming.

## The Problem: PR Chaos

If you work in a modern development environment, you probably recognize this scenario:

- You have **multiple repositories** to monitor
- Your team uses **GitHub** for some projects and **GitLab** for others
- PRs pile up and **notifications get lost** in your email or Slack
- You're constantly **switching tabs** between GitHub, GitLab, and your IDE
- You miss urgent reviews because there's just **too much noise**

Sound familiar? This context-switching not only wastes time but breaks your flow and reduces your productivity.

## The Solution: One App to Rule Them All

**PR Manager** was built specifically to solve this problem. It's a desktop application that brings all your Pull Requests into a single, organized interface.

### Unified Dashboard

See all your PRs in one place. No more switching between browser tabs or losing track of pending reviews. Each PR card shows you everything you need at a glance:

- Repository name and provider
- PR title and number
- Author information
- CI/CD status
- Review status (approved, changes requested, pending)
- Comment count

### Native Notifications

Get real-time notifications directly on your desktop. Unlike email or Slack notifications that get buried, PR Manager's native alerts ensure you never miss an important review request.

You can also follow specific PRs to get notified about:
- New commits
- New comments
- Review status changes
- When a PR is ready to merge

### Custom Views

Create personalized views with filters to organize your PRs exactly how you want them:

- **My PRs** - everything you've opened
- **Needs Review** - PRs waiting for your review
- **By Repository** - filter by specific repos
- **Approved** - PRs ready to merge
- **Draft PRs** - work in progress

### Quick Actions

Take action directly from the app without opening your browser:

- **Approve** PRs with one click
- **Request changes** with a comment
- **Add comments** to provide feedback
- **Merge** PRs when they're ready

### Pin Important PRs

Have a critical PR you need to keep an eye on? Pin it to your Pinned view for quick access. Pinned PRs stay at your fingertips until you're done with them.

## Available on macOS and Windows

PR Manager is a native desktop application available for:

- **macOS** - Native Apple Silicon and Intel support
- **Windows** - Optimized for Windows 10 and 11

No matter what operating system you use, PR Manager provides the same consistent experience.

## Works with Your Providers

We support the two most popular Git hosting platforms:

- **GitHub** - Personal accounts and organizations
- **GitLab** - GitLab.com and self-hosted instances

Currently, you can connect **either** GitHub or GitLab to manage your PRs. Multi-provider support (using both GitHub and GitLab simultaneously) is on our roadmap for a future release.

## Who Is It For?

PR Manager is designed for:

- **Individual developers** who want to stay on top of their code reviews
- **Tech leads** who need to monitor PRs across multiple repositories
- **Teams** that work with multiple Git providers
- **Open source maintainers** who manage contributions across projects
